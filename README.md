# Discodelete

Discodelete is a Discord bot that can be configured to run through messages on certain channels of a server and delete messages older than a certain age in hours or above a certain number of recent messages or both, preserving pinned messages.

## Setting up

To run the bot, you will need a computer with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) installed, as well as the `discord.py` package, which you can install with the following command:
```
pip3 install discord
```

You will then need an application ID and bot token, which you can obtain on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) after creating an application and generating a bot token. Make sure to copy the bot token somewhere, as it is only ever displayed once, and you must reset the token, triggering two-factor authentication, to get another.

You may then add the bot to the server you wish to use it on by visiting a URL like this in a browser:
`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APPLICATION_ID_GOES_HERE&permissions=2147560448&scope=bot`
where `APPLICATION_ID_GOES_HERE` is the application ID shown for the bot under Settings/General Information.

This gives the bot the following permissions on the server you select in the browser: Read Messages/View Channels, Read Message History, Send Messages, Manage Messages, Use Slash Commands.

## Initial run and configuration

In the correct directory, run Melodelete on the command line:
```
python3 melodelete.py
```

It will create a skeleton `config.json` file for you to fill with your bot token and the ID of the server you want to automatically delete older messages on.

* The bot token is obtained during the process to create the Discord application. It is only displayed once after it is generated.
* To get the ID of a server, go into your Discord User Settings, then, under App Settings/Advanced, enable Developer Mode. Exit User Settings, then, on the server in question, right-click (Desktop or Web) or tap (Mobile) the server's header, then select Copy Server ID.

## Running Interactively

In the correct directory, run Melodelete on the command line:
```
python3 melodelete.py
```

## Running as a service
To have this run after logging out, you need to set this up to run as a service. For simplicity here I assume an EC2 instance where the default username is ec2-user

1. Create a file somewhere on your system and label it as `melodelete.service`
2. Open the file and paste the following
```
[Unit]
Description=Melodelete service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=idle
Restart=on-failure
User=ec2-user
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'cd <path to melodelete root> && python3 melodelete.py'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
3. Run the following commands from the melodelete root
```
sudo cp melodelete.service /lib/systemd/system/
cd /lib/systemd/system/
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/melodelete.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable melodelete.service
sudo systemctl start melodelete.service
sudo systemctl start melodelete
```



Other commands you can use with this
```
# stop a service
sudo systemctl stop melodelete.service

# restart a service
sudo systemctl restart melodelete.service

# reload a service
sudo systemctl reload melodelete.service

# enable a service
sudo systemctl enable melodelete.service

# disable a service
sudo systemctl disable melodelete.service

# get the status log of a service
systemctl status melodelete.service
```
